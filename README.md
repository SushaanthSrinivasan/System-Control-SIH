# System Control Tool using gesture recognition

## About:

A system control tool leveraging gesture recognition technology. Developed using Python, Tensorflow, and Flask, the prototype enables users to control system functions through hand gestures and facial recognition.

### Features:

- **Progressive WebApp Prototype**: A user-friendly web application prototype that facilitates system control via hand gestures and facial recognition security.

- **Deep Learning Models**: LSTM and perceptron networks enables accurate gesture recognition for static and dynamic gestures

- **Secure and Intuitive Design**: The application's design prioritizes security with preset facial recognition, accessibility, and user intuitiveness for a seamless user experience.

**Note**: Submitted the project to university hackathon - won 2nd place in the software category
